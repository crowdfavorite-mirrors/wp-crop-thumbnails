"Crop Thumbnails" made it easy to get exacly that specific image-detail you want to show in the automatic cropped post-thumbnails.

== Description ==

The plugin enhance functionality to crop your automatic cropped post-thumbnails individuell and simple. It add links in the backend to enter all images you had attached to a post, page or custom-post.
In the Crop-Editor you can choose one or more (if they have the same ratio) imagesizes and cut-off the part of the image you want.

= Further Features =

* It is possible to filter the list of available image-sizes (in dependency to post-types) in the settings (Settings > Crop-Thumbnails).
* You could provide your users a custom style for the Editor-Window.

== Installation ==

You can use the built in installer and upgrader, or you can install the plugin manually.

1. You can either use the automatic plugin installer or your FTP program to upload it to your wp-content/plugins directory the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in /wp-content/plugins/.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure any settings from "Settings > Crop-Thumbnails".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What languages are supported? =
* English
* German (de_DE)
* brazilian portuguese (pt_BR) - thanks to Alex Meusburger
* Ukrainian (uk) - thanks to Jurko Chervony from www.skinik.name

= What internal rules use the plugin for cropping? =
* The plugin will only crop image-sizes where crop is set to "true" (hard crop mode - see: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_image_size).
* If you had set one of image dimension in add_image_size to "0" or "9999" (an set crop to true) the plugin will crop it in the ratio of the original image.
* You are able to crop all images with the same ratio at once (default) or and any imagesize (and ratio) seperate.

= I have cropped the image but the old one is used on the page. =
If you had viewed your image on the site before, your browser has cached the image. Go tell them to reload the fresh image from the server by hitting "F5".

= Is it possible to crop an non-cropped image-size? =
No. The purpose of this plugin is to provide control for the wordpress automatic crop. If you want to crop let's say the full-size image you should
* a) upload it in a better format in the first place
* OR b) use the Standard Wordpress-Image editor to crop the image.

= Is it possible to adjust the css-style of the crop-thumbnail window? =
Yes, for a simple test, copy the css/cpt-window.css file into your template_directory and make some change.
Then add this code into the functions.php of your template.

`add_filter('crop_post_thumbnail_window_css','myCustomStyle');
function myCustomStyle($content) {
	$content = get_bloginfo('template_directory').'/cpt-window.css';
	return $content;
}`

= Can i make the modal-dialog fullscreen? =
Yes, i added a filter with some settings for the modal-dialog, so you can adjust the size:
`add_filter('crop_thumbnails_modal_window_settings','crop_thumbnails_modal_window_settings_override');
function crop_thumbnails_modal_window_settings_override($param) {
	$param['limitToWidth'] = false; //You may set a number, then thats the maximum width the modal can be. On small screens it will be smaller (see offsets). Set to FALSE if you want no limit.
	$param['maxWidthOffset'] = 0; //window-width minus "width_offset" equals modal-width
	$param['maxHeightOffset'] = 0; //window-width minus "height_offset" equals modal-height
	return $param;
}`

= I have show the cropped image in the backend in an custom meta-box. It does not update after the modal-dialog closed. Is there a way to fix this =
Yeah, there is a way. After the crop-thumbnails-modal closed it triggeres a javascript event on the body element. You could use jQuery to cache-break your cropped thumbnail (in backend-view).
The event called "cropThumbnailModalClosed". The plugin also provides a global function that could be called (only in post-edit-view and mediathek) to do the cache-break.
Example-Code:
`$('body').on('cropThumbnailModalClosed',function() {
	CROP_THUMBNAILS_DO_CACHE_BREAK( $('.your-image-selector') );
});`

= I want to contribute code. =
Fantastic, i published the code on github: https://github.com/vollyimnetz/crop-thumbnails. But be warned, i am carefully evaluate new features.

If you fork and planning to publish the forked plugin, please contact me.
